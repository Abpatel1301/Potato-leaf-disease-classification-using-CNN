The world population is increasing at a rapid rate, and so is the demand for food. With the advancements in agricultural technology, combined with the use of artificial intelligence to predict diseases in crops, it becomes important to make relevant research to ensure sustainable agricultural development.
Agriculture is the cultivation of land and raising of crops to produce food. It is a form of subsistence farming that has been practiced for thousands of years. With the advancement in technology and the use of artificial intelligence in diagnosing plant diseases, it becomes important to make pertinent research toward sustainable agricultural development.
In the past, diagnosis of plant diseases was done by observing the symptoms of a diseased plant. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence and its application to agriculture, it becomes important to make pertinent research in this area. With the use of image processing and deep learning algorithms, it is now possible to diagnose a plant disease by using a picture taken from a smartphone.
The advancement of agricultural technology has made it possible to grow more crops with limited resources. However, the increase in the population of the world is constantly increasing the demand for more food. One way to meet this demand is to use artificial intelligence in diagnosing plant diseases and using that information to more efficiently grow food.
